Create a Repository and Initialize

To make a new folder:
$ mkdir hello-world

To go into that folder:
$ cd hello-world

To create a new Git instance for a project:
$ git init

type git status and if it doesn't return 'fatal: Not a git repository...', you're golden!

Step: Status, Add and Commit Changes

See if there are changes listed:
$ git status

Then add the file you just created to the files you'd like to commit (aka save) to change.
$ git add readme.txt

Finally, commit those changes to the repository's history with a short description of the updates.
$ git commit -m "<your commit message>"

In terminal, you can view the difference between the file now and how it was at your last commit.
$ git diff

Add your GitHub username to your configuration (remember!! correct caps):
$ git config --global user.username <USerNamE>
